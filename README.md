### So what does this really do?
MEGATOME fetches the latest tweets in the key of #sworcery and displays them, then regularly polls for new tweets you haven't seen yet and pushes them to the top. It also keeps track of which users have tweeted particular bits of dialogue, so you can see which segments of dialogue are the most popular.
